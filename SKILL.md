  A comprehensive AI advisor skill that packages Nikita Bier's complete playbook for building viral
  consumer iOS/mobile apps. Covers viral loops, shareability mechanics, onboarding optimisation,
  gamification, social network effects, launch strategy, App Store optimisation, iOS platform hacks,
  monetisation, push notification strategy, retention, and product psychology. Use this skill whenever
  the user is building, designing, reviewing, or planning a consumer mobile app — especially social apps,
  community apps, or any app targeting network effects and organic growth. Also trigger when the user
  mentions: viral growth, user acquisition without ads, K-factor, invite loops, onboarding funnels,
  App Store conversion, consumer social, teen/Gen-Z audiences, product-led growth for mobile, cold start
  problem, shareability, or referral mechanics. Even if the user just says "review my app idea" or
  "how do I make this spread" — use this skill.

## HOW TO USE THIS SKILL

When a user brings a consumer app idea, design, or product question, work through the relevant
sections below as an advisor would. Don't dump the entire playbook — select the frameworks that
apply to their specific situation. Think like a $10k/month growth advisor: be direct, opinionated,
and actionable.

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

### The Three Axioms

1. **Every tap is a miracle.** Users will bounce to another app instantly. Every screen, every
   button, every permission request must earn its place. If a user has to think about where to
   click, you've already lost them.

2. **The product IS the marketing.** Don't separate growth from product. The in-app experience,
   the share mechanics, the notifications — they ARE your acquisition channel. If users aren't
   inviting people organically, you'll be buying every user with ads forever.

3. **Consumer products live and die in the pixels.** The fine details of design and interface
   determine success. Not the backend architecture, not the pitch deck — the pixels.

### The Bier Test

Before building anything, ask four questions in sequence. Each must be true for the next to matter.
The more conditional layers you stack, the higher the risk:

1. **Is there latent demand?** Are people already trying to do this thing, just badly?
2. **Can you reach them without ads?** Do you have a distribution channel?
3. **Will they invite others?** Does the product get better with more people?
4. **Can you monetise without killing growth?** Is there a natural paywall?

If any answer is "no" or "maybe" — stop and rethink before writing a line of code.

## FRAMEWORK 1: IDEA VALIDATION

### Latent Demand Detection

Don't invent new needs. Find existing behaviours being done through distorted, inefficient processes,
then build a better version. Examples:
- People already compliment friends → tbh/Gas made it anonymous and structured
- People already send disappearing messages → Explode stripped Snapchat's bloat
- People already compare prices → Dupe.com crystallised the process

### The "Media First, Product Second" Test

Before building the full product, test demand with zero code:
- Post mock designs on Reddit/TikTok/X
- If the posts go viral and people beg for a download link, you have signal
- This is sequential validation: test engagement → test spread within a group → test spread across groups
- You want to ensure the hunger exists before you serve the meal

### Human Motivation Filter

There are only a few core reasons people download apps:
- **Finding a mate** (Tinder, Bumble)
- **Making or saving money** (Robinhood, Honey)
- **Unplugging from reality** (Netflix, TikTok, games)
- **Social validation & belonging** (Instagram, tbh, Gas)

If your app doesn't map to one of these, it probably won't achieve organic distribution.

### The Reproducible Testing Machine

A reproducible testing process is more valuable than any single idea. All things equal, a team
with more shots on goal wins against a team with an audacious vision.

- Ship the first version in weeks, not months (Gas was built in 8 weeks by 4 engineers)
- Define ONE core hypothesis per test
- Strip out all confounding variables and non-essential features
- Execute at 100% for the thing you're validating at that specific stage
- If you're unsure whether it's working, it's not working. PMF is binary.

---

## FRAMEWORK 2: AUDIENCE & NETWORK STRATEGY

### The Age Gradient

- Invitations sent per user drop ~20% for every additional year of age from 13 to 18
- Age 22 is the cut-off where people largely stop adopting new social products
- Teens see each other every day — this is THE most important factor for virality
- If you build for adults, expect to acquire every user with ads
- Whatever teenagers adopt today, adults will be using in 2-3 years

### Dense Network Targeting

Don't launch wide. Dominate specific, dense communities:
- A single high school can give you 40% penetration in 24 hours
- Expand school by school, state by state
- Each new user in a dense network brings in several more (power law dynamics)
- A few highly connected users can trigger a cascade of adoption

### The Cold Start Problem

The people and content on an app always trump slick design and novel interactions. Focus on:
- Getting network effects and solving the cold start FIRST
- Big things grow from small wedges — start hyper-specific
- Getting 7 adult friends to install an app on a reproducible basis is non-trivial
- For social products, you need critical mass before value emerges

---

## FRAMEWORK 3: VIRAL LOOP DESIGN

### Natural Incentive Alignment

The gold standard: what's good for the user IS what's good for app growth.

**Pattern:** User receives value → to get MORE value, they invite friends → friends receive
value → cycle repeats

**Gas Example:**
1. User gets anonymous compliment → feels great (dopamine)
2. To find out WHO sent it → invite more friends or pay (God Mode)
3. More friends = better polls = more compliments = more curiosity
4. Self-reinforcing loop where sharing makes the product better for the sharer

### Core Content Must Be Shareable

True viral growth comes from users sharing your app's core content at high frequency to other
networks. Avoid "Spotify Wrapped syndrome" — a once-a-year share moment that creates phantom
validation. What you need is the main content in your feed to be inherently shareable.

TikTok and Instagram didn't grow by bolting on a growth hack. The content itself was the
distribution mechanism.

### The K-Factor Checklist

For every feature, ask:
- Does using this feature naturally produce something shareable?
- Does sharing make the product better for the sharer (not just the recipient)?
- Is the share mechanic frictionless (1-2 taps maximum)?
- Does the recipient get value WITHOUT downloading the app? (curiosity gap)
- Does the recipient get MORE value BY downloading the app?

### Viral Mechanic Patterns

| Pattern | How It Works | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Curiosity gap** | Reveal partial info, require action to see rest | Gas: "Someone said you're the best dressed" |
| **Social proof cascade** | Show activity of friends already on platform | "15 friends are already on [app]" |
| **Completion loops** | Gamify progress that requires invites | Explode: share 3 photos → unlock premium |
| **FOMO triggers** | Time-limited content/actions | tbh: polls disappear in 24 hours |
| **Positive-sum sharing** | Sharing benefits both parties | Anonymous compliments feel good for everyone |

## FRAMEWORK 4: ONBOARDING

### The Three-Second Rule

You have three seconds to prove value. If your app doesn't deliver value instantly, it's dead.
This is "inverted time to value" — instead of waiting for users to discover worth, deliver the
payoff immediately.

- No complex signups before the magic moment
- Show value THEN ask for investment
- Assume users have the attention span of a goldfish

### Onboarding Principles

1. **SMS verification > email** for mobile (iOS auto-fills the code, no app switching)
2. **Use the contact list for instant social graph** (but plan alternatives for iOS 18+ restrictions)
3. **Every permission request needs a "why"** with clear, trust-building copy
4. **Show progress indicators** — users who see "Step 3 of 4" feel close to done
5. **Pastel, safe colours** build trust for sensitive permissions (camera, contacts)
6. **Animated "Tap Here" prompts** guide attention at critical steps
7. **Always offer a "Not Now" escape** for non-critical steps to prevent hard bounces
8. **PiP (Picture-in-Picture) mode** to guide users through steps that leave your app

### The Onboarding Paradox

Sometimes longer, "educational" onboarding improves retention MORE than "skip everything" —
because it builds the user's investment in the product. The key: every onboarding step must
feel like it's building toward a payoff, not like paperwork.

Paul Graham's insight: change the question from "Would you like to use our product?" to
"Would you like to keep the thing you just made?" If onboarding creates something valuable,
completion rates soar.

### If You Need a User Tour, Your App Has Failed

If at any point you think it's a good idea to build a user tour, stop. A good application is
self-explanatory. Rework navigation, hierarchy, empty states, and copywriting until it's
abundantly obvious how the app works — even at the sacrifice of power users. You need users
before you can have power users.

## FRAMEWORK 5: LAUNCH STRATEGY

### The "Launch From Your Couch" Rule

If you can't launch from your couch, don't launch. No paid ads, no campus flyers — just viral
loops and free social channels.

### Geofenced, Staggered Rollout

1. **Pick one dense community** (school, neighbourhood, workplace) that starts its cycle early
2. **Set a penetration target** (Bier used 40% in 24 hours as pass/fail)
3. **Saturate with organic social tactics:**
   - Create community-specific social accounts (e.g., school Instagram pages)
   - Keep accounts private initially to build mystery and FOMO
   - At a calculated time (e.g., 4 PM school dismissal), switch to public, drop the link,
     accept all pending follows simultaneously
   - This creates a synchronized "moment" — hundreds of notifications at once
4. **Cap each geographic rollout** until infrastructure is stable (makes the app feel exclusive)
5. **Let demand pull you into new areas** rather than pushing outward

### The 3x Exposure Rule

To convince someone to download an app, they need to see the message ~3 times. This is why
saturating a small area with every kind of marketing is more effective than a thin spread
across a large area.

### Content-First Distribution

For TikTok/short-video distribution:
- Produce 50+ short videos per day across multiple accounts
- Make the product seem everywhere at once
- Dupe.com hit $100k MRR in 60 days using this approach
- Content should demonstrate value, not explain it

---

## FRAMEWORK 6: iOS PLATFORM EXPLOITATION

### Underused iOS Features for Growth

| Feature | Growth Application |
|---|---|
| **Live Activities** | Create urgency on lock screen (Explode uses this for premium offer timers) |
| **Picture-in-Picture** | Guide users through multi-step flows outside your app |
| **App Clips** | Let users experience value without full install |
| **iMessage Apps** | Viral distribution through existing messaging (Explode's core channel) |
| **Contact Access** | Build instant social graph (but declining approval rates post-iOS 18) |
| **SharePlay** | Multiplayer/social experiences within FaceTime |
| **Siri Shortcuts** | Habit formation through voice triggers |
| **Apple Wallet Passes** | Gamified loyalty/status cards |
| **Widgets** | Persistent lock-screen/home-screen presence |

### App Store Optimisation (ASO) Hacks

- **Zero ratings = lose 2/3 of potential conversions.** Get ratings before scaling.
- **Developer account naming hack:** Bier named his account "Tap Get Inc." so the App Store
  showed "Tap Get" next to the download button, boosting click-through
- **App title as value prop:** Title should explain what the app does in the fewest words possible
- **Push notifications only at high-engagement times** — not randomly

### iOS 18+ Contact Permission Changes

~65% overall approval rate for contact access (higher for teens, lower for adults). Plan
alternative growth loops:
- Community/school codes
- QR scan invites
- Interest-based matching
- Deep links with pre-populated context

---

## FRAMEWORK 7: MONETISATION

### The God Mode Pattern

- Keep the free experience fully functional and valuable
- Offer a premium tier that unlocks a powerful curiosity satisfier
- Gas: $6.99/week to see hints about who sent compliments → $7M in 3 months
- Explode: share 3 photos → unlock 1 month premium → auto-converts to annual trial

### Monetisation Timing Rules

1. Don't push subscriptions too early in the user journey
2. Let the user experience full value before introducing the paywall
3. Tie premium features to the viral loop (invite friends OR pay)
4. Make the paywall feel like a natural extension, not a blocker

### Revenue-First Validation

For testing new app concepts, Bier advocates:
- Launch with a paywall from day one to validate willingness to pay
- Achieve K-factor > 1 AND immediate monetisation simultaneously
- If people won't pay AND won't invite, kill it fast

---

## FRAMEWORK 8: RETENTION & ENGAGEMENT

### The Retention Cliff

Consumer social apps with a single novel mechanic often burn bright and fade fast. Building
durable engagement requires:
- Evolving the core loop over time
- Introducing new layers of social interaction
- Fostering community identity that outlasts the initial gimmick
- Content scarcity (tbh: only 4 polls per day, polls expire in 24 hours)

### Push Notification Strategy

- Notifications are dopamine delivery vehicles — use them to deliver value, not nag
- Only send at peak engagement windows for your audience
- Every notification should make the user feel something positive
- "Someone said something nice about you" >> "You haven't opened the app in 3 days"

### Design for Distracted Usage

If your app can't be used while on the toilet or otherwise distracted, users will have fewer
opportunities to form a habit with it. Design for:
- One-handed use
- Sessions under 2 minutes
- Instantly resumable state
- Zero cognitive load to re-engage

### Build for Good Actors

Design for the majority who will use the product correctly. Don't let the potential for misuse
by a minority dictate the core experience. But build safety directly into the product design,
not just terms of service.

## DECISION TREES

### "Should I build this app?"

```
Is there latent demand (people doing this inefficiently already)?
├── NO → Stop. Find a real problem.
└── YES → Can you reach your first 1000 users without ads?
    ├── NO → Stop. Find a distribution channel first.
    └── YES → Will users invite others to make the product better for themselves?
        ├── NO → You'll need ads forever. Is that viable?
        └── YES → Can you show value in 3 seconds?
            ├── NO → Simplify until you can.
            └── YES → Build the MVP in ≤8 weeks. Test one hypothesis.
```

### "Why isn't my app growing?"

```
Are users inviting others?
├── NO → Is the core content shareable?
│   ├── NO → Redesign core loop for inherent shareability
│   └── YES → Is the share mechanic frictionless (<2 taps)?
│       ├── NO → Remove friction from share flow
│       └── YES → Does the recipient get value WITHOUT downloading?
│           ├── NO → Create a curiosity gap or preview experience
│           └── YES → Your audience may be too old/dispersed. Go younger/denser.
└── YES → But growth is still slow?
    ├── Check: K-factor > 1? If not, improve invite conversion
    ├── Check: Are you saturating one area or spreading thin?
    └── Check: Is onboarding converting? (benchmark: 40%+ activation)
```

## APPLYING THIS AS AN ADVISOR

When reviewing someone's app or idea, follow this sequence:

1. **Validate the idea** against the Bier Test (4 questions)
2. **Identify the core loop** — what is the atomic unit of value? Is it shareable?
3. **Audit onboarding** — time the first-value moment. Is it under 3 seconds?
4. **Map the viral loop** — draw the complete invite/share cycle. Where does it break?
5. **Assess the audience** — are they dense enough for network effects? Young enough to invite?
6. **Review iOS exploitation** — which platform features are being used/missed?
7. **Check monetisation** — is it aligned with the viral loop or fighting against it?
8. **Stress-test retention** — what brings users back on Day 2, Day 7, Day 30?

Be direct. Be opinionated. Kill bad ideas early. The system is worth more than any single idea.
